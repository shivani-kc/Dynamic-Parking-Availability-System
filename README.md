# 🚗 Dynamic Parking Availability System

![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)

**🟢 Hardware Project – Fully Implemented & Tested**

A real-time smart parking monitoring system using **PIC16F877A**, **ultrasonic & IR sensors**, **DHT11**, and **LCD interface**. Designed for efficient parking management and easy scalability.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Detect real-time parking slot occupancy.
- Count vehicle entry and exit using IR sensors.
- Display available slots and environmental conditions.
- Provide visual feedback via LEDs for quick status checking.
- Build a modular, low-cost embedded system prototype.

---

## 🧠 System Workflow

### 1. Sensor Interfacing
- **Ultrasonic sensor** → Measures distance to detect if slot is occupied.
- **IR sensors** → Track vehicle entry and exit.
- **DHT11 sensor** → Measures temperature and humidity.

### 2. Processing (PIC16F877A)
- Debouncing for IR sensors.
- Timer-based distance measurement.
- Checksum validation for DHT11.
- Slot availability counter.

### 3. Output Systems
- **LCD display** for:
  - Free slots  
  - Temperature  
  - Humidity  
- **LED indicators**:
  - 🔴 Red → Slot occupied  
  - 🟢 Green → Slot free
